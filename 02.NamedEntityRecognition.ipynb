    "Realme Buds T300 are a great choice for this price range! Here's what I observed with the unit of product I received:\n",
    "\n",
    "Charging : They support Fast Charging. The most interesting and important part about this is that realme claims that 10 minutes of charge can provide around 7 hours of playback which I found to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mic Quality : I tested the mic quality and it seemed interesting. It apparently depends on which mode you're using these buds which heavily affects the mic quality. For example, when I call with this without Noise Cancellation on, it actually cancels the noise from my audio. But when I don't use Noise Cancellation, it doesn't suppresses the background noise. And there's this issue I'm having with the device that my phone or my PC doesn't seems to be able to use the mic of this device while I'm not in a call. Mic quality is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Volume Control & Sound Quality : Here comes the best part. The Bass on this thing is extremely good. You can actually make it even better by using the realme link app to change the modes on this device. All in all, it's great for music listeners. This product is recommended if you're looking for a good music listening experience at the this price range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Appearance : There is no doubt that this thing looks absolutely professional. It has a really sleek design and it feels very smooth when you hold it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Build Quality : I don't know if it's just me but I feel like the build quality of this thing isn't that good. Especially the lid of the case. When I open the case, I have a feeling that the lid might break if I push it a bit too hard. Of course, that wouldn't happen and I tried it. The lid of the case, overall feels a bit loose. I don't know if that's a defect in the unit I got or is it the standard. Either way, I'm not really satisfied with this defect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Button Control : There is a button to control media on this device. There are three possible combinations that one can use on both the sides of the earbuds. It comes with defaults but you can configure the buttons in the realme link app. I personally found the usage of buttons quite limited. But it's good for simplicity of controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise Cancellation : BY FAR, THE BEST PART. Personally, I'm someone who comes from a community that uses headphones a lot. I have one wired headphones with me which used to be my main before I got this. I have ALWAYS wanted Noise Cancellation and since I used headphones that didn't support it. It was a big thing for me. This was the best part in my opinion of these earbuds. They support upto -30db of Noise Cancellation and it actually works damn well. To get Ambient Noise Cancellation in this budget is quite crazy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bluetooth 5.3 : It has Bluetooth 5.3 and Wake & Pair and in my opinion, it works pretty well.\n",
    "\n",
    "IP55 Rating : It has a rating of IP55 so it's resistant from water splashes/sweat and light amount of dust. Of course, I had to test it and it seems that it really is resistant to water splashes and dust. I tested it in such environments and it still works great. No problemo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dolby Atmos : It also has Dolby Atmos which, personally, I didn't notice that much but when I was testing this feature, I shifted my focus to the 360° audio and it surely seemed like it works and pretty well at that. It could be my imagination though so don't take my word for it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "App : You can use realme link app to further configure the settings of this device and it's pretty decent. You get options to change audio modes, button functionality, etc. So it's pretty decent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, I think that these earbuds are extremely good for their price range and you should definitely go for it if you're a music lover or you just need earbuds for day-to-day tasks.\n",
