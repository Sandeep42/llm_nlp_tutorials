# LLMs for Traditional NLP Tasks
================================

This repository contains a collection of notebooks that demonstrate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for traditional NLP tasks.

## Notebooks

### 01. Text Classification
------------------------

*   **Text Classification using Large Language Models (LLMs)**
    *   Explore the use of LLMs for text classification tasks using a few-shot learning approach.
    *   Compare the advantages and disadvantages of LLMs versus traditional text classification models.

### Notebook Structure

*   Traditional Models: Discuss traditional approaches to text classification.
*   LLMs: Explore the use of LLMs for text classification, including zero shot and few shot learning.
*   Validation: Validate the performance of the few shot LLM on a test dataset.

### Key Takeaways

*   LLMs offer a new approach to text classification with potential accuracy improvements and reduced manual feature engineering.
*   However, LLMs have high computational requirements and potential data security and privacy issues while using private models.
